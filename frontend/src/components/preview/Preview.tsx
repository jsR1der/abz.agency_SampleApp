            <h1>Ukraine</h1>
            <p>The flag of Ukraine consists of two horizontal stripes of equal width. The top stripe is blue,
                symbolizing the sky, while the bottom stripe is yellow, representing the fertile wheat fields of the
                country. This simple and striking design reflects Ukraine's rich agricultural heritage and the natural
                beauty of its landscape. The flag's colors are deeply significant in Ukrainian culture and history,
                symbolizing peace and prosperity.</p>
